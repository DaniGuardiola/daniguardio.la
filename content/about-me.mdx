Hi! I'm Dani, a musician and software engineer from Spain.

![Me](/me.png)

I know a little bit about a lot of things.

**Some of the stuff I enjoy:** music, engineering, animals, interface design, free software (as in freedom), reverse-engineering, and not taking things seriously. Cats, too.

I do many unrelated things all the time, mostly for _fun_.
