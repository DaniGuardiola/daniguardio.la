# Self-love

I've always found the idea of liking your own posts funny. I don't have anything against loving oneself, but it's still funny.

In fact, I might have done it myself in the past, but in a more... sneaky way: I used to like my main account tweets from my hidden account so that no one could find out. I'm not the one who's gonna judge.

However, I still wanted to find those self-liked tweets, so I decided to create a web extension that does exactly that! I called it **Egolatron**.

  Well, I built a browser extension that detects self-likes.
  
  I call it "Egolatron". Coming soon to the Chrome Web Store.`}

# The strategy

To create such an extension, we need to come up with a few things, including:

- A way to detect tweets loaded into the DOM by the Twitter client.
- A way to extract the tweet IDs and authors from the tweet elements.
- A way to get the list of users who liked those tweets (to check if the author is among them).
- Cool styles 😎 for self-liked tweets.
- A way to apply those styles.

The obvious part is that we're gonna need to load our script inside opened Twitter tabs. That's easily achieved with an [extension content script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts). We just need to declare it in the [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json):

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://twitter.com/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, the basic workflow is the following:

1. Detect new tweets.
2. Analyze them to find out if they're self-liked.
3. When self-liked tweets are visible on the screen, render the styles.

# Implementation

> You can check the full implementation [here](https://github.com/DaniGuardiola/egolatron/blob/main/extension/content-script.js) (it's open source!). These are only some simplified fragments that I think are worth sharing, but they are mostly pseudo-code.

## Detecting tweets

There are many ways to go about this, but I didn't want to make things complicated, so I opted for a simple (but far from perfect approach).

Here are two important facts I found about DOM tweets:

- They are `<article>` elements.
- They all contain a link to the tweet itself that looks like this:

  `https://twitter.com/<author>/status/<id>`

  This link is often the tweet date:

  ![The date links to the tweet itself](tweet-link.png)

With this information, I coded a function that detects them:

```javascript
function getDOMTweets () {
  // get all article elements, as they are potential tweets
  const tweetEls = [...document.querySelectorAll('article')]
  return tweetEls
    .map(element => {
      // obtain all links inside the article element
      const links = [...element.querySelectorAll('a')]
      let match
      links.forEach(function (link) {
        // tweets contain at least one link matching this regexp pattern,
        // which also captures the username and tweet ID
        const pattern = /^https:\/\/twitter\.com\/([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\/status\/([0-9]+)\/?$/
        match = link.href.match(pattern) || match
      })
      if (!match) return // no match, this is not a tweet
      const user = match[1] // first capture group contains the username
      const id = match[2] // second capture group contains the tweet ID
      return { user, id, element }
    })
    .filter(item => item) // filter out non-tweets
}
```

This function will return all detected tweets in the form of an array of `{ user, id, element }` objects.

To keep the list of tweets up-to-date, we need to execute this periodically in a loop:

```javascript
async function updateTweetsLoop () {
  // obtain the tweets from DOM
  const domTweets = getDOMTweets()
  // "update" each tweet found
  domTweets.forEach(updateTweet)
  // recursively call this function again in 200 ms
  setTimeout(() => updateTweetsLoop(100), 100)
}

function updateTweet (tweetData) {
  // do stuff...
}
```

## Analyzing tweets

Now that we have the tweets, we need to check if they've been self-liked.

The straightforward way to achieve this is by retrieving the list of users who liked a certain tweet, and looking for the author on it.

We can find out about this API call by using the ["Network" tab from the DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network):

1. Open the DevTools panel and go to the "Network" tab.
2. Trigger the API call by opening the like list of a tweet.
   ![The button to open tweet likes](like-ui.png)
3. Inspect the request using the DevTools.

By doing this we can see that the resource we need is `api.twitter.com/2/timeline/liked_by.json?tweet_id=<ID>`.

The API requires an authentication token among the request headers:

![Auth token](token-1.png)

It's almost as if this token is screaming.

![AAAAAAAAAAAAAA](token-2.png)

After spending some time looking for this token, I finally found it in a JavaScript file by searching for it on the DevTools with a regular expression:

![Token found!](token-3.png)

It seems like it is included in the main JavaScript bundle of the application. This file's name is `main.<hash>.js` and it is being loaded at the end of the body with a `<script>` tag. It is also being preloaded with a `<link rel="preload" as="script">` in the `<head>`:

![Main bundle preload](token-4.png)

If we take a look at a formatted version of this file, we can spot the token there:

![The token inside the main bundle](token-5.png)

With this knowledge, we can do something like this to obtain this token:

```javascript
async function getBearerToken () {
  // find the link tag and get its 'href' value
  const scriptUrl = document.querySelector(
    'link[href^="https://abs.twimg.com/responsive-web/client-web/main."]'
  ).href
  // fetch the file and get it as text
  const scriptContent = await (await fetch(scriptUrl)).text()
  // extract the bearer token
  const bearerToken = scriptContent.match(/"(AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9%]*)/)[1]
  return bearerToken
}
```

Notice how we are looking for the `<link>` tag by using the selector `link[href^=.../main.]`. This is because tools like Webpack add hashes to these bundles.

This means that a bundle could be named `main.123456789.js` in one build and `main.abcdefghi.js` in the next one. To make our selector resilient to hash changes, we are using the `[attr^=value]` selector, which matches an element that has the attribute `attr` with a value that starts with `value`.

Then we are using the URL to re-fetch the script (as text). Finally, we use a regular expression to find the bearer token inside the minified bundle code.

This method is more or less equivalent to this method of fixing cars:

![Car repair!](token-6.png)

But you know what? It works! Now we have everything we need to use the API for our evil purposes 😈. Only 180 times every 15 minutes though, because it is rate-limited 😔.

```javascript
function updateTweet (tweetData) {
  checkIfSelfLiked(tweetData)
}
```

Of course, the `updateTweet` function is called from inside the loop, which is executed constantly. We don't want our script to make a bazillion API calls (remember the rate limit), so we need to check whether it is a new tweet or if it has already been checked:

```javascript
function updateTweet (tweetData) {
  if (isNewTweet(tweetData)) {
    checkIfSelfLiked(tweetData)
  }
}
```

When the check is done, we will store the result in memory to use it later.

## Cool styles 😎

I thought it'd be fun to style self-liked tweets in a cool and funny way.

I wanted to give those tweets a "medal", so I made this SVG of a medal using Inkscape:

![Egolatron medal](medal.png)

Then, whenever a self-lifed tweet was visible, I inyected it into the element and added a class for additional styles:

```javascript
function renderSelfLiked (tweetElement) {
  tweetElement.element.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', SVG_MEDAL)
  tweetElement.classList.add('self-liked')
}
```

The additional styles take care of three important things:

- Animate the medal dropping initially
- Animate the swinging of the medal
- Add a top red border to the tweet

These CSS styles look like this:

```css
.self-liked {
  border-top: solid red 4px;
}

.self-liked svg {
  top: -20px;
  animation-duration: 0.5s, 2s;
  animation-name: medal_drop, medal_swing;
  animation-iteration-count: 1, infinite;
}
@keyframes medal_drop {
  0% {
    top: -95px;
  }
  100% {
    top: 0;
  }
}
@keyframes medal_swing {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(-4deg) translateX(4px);
  }
  50% {
    transform: rotate(4deg) translateX(-4px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(-4deg) translateX(4px);
  }
}
```

- The `medal_drop` animation happens once (at the beginning) because it has an `animation-iteration-count` value of `1`.
- The `medal_swing` animation repeats infinitely because it has an `animation-iteration-count` value of `infinite`.

## Applying the cool styles

The `updateTweet` now needs to render these styles for self-liked tweets:

```javascript
function updateTweet (tweetData) {
  if (isNewTweet(tweetData)) {
    checkIfSelfLiked(tweetData)
  } else if (isSelfLiked(tweetData)) {
    renderSelfLiked(tweetData.element)
  }
}
```

Additionally, I wanted these styles to render only once the tweet is fully visible (inside the viewport of the browser). We can assert that with a function like this:

```javascript
function isElementVisible (element) {
  const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect()
  return rect.top >= 0 && rect.bottom <= window.innerHeight
}
```

The `.getBoundingClientRect()` function will give us the position of the element (we need `top` and `bottom`). We can then do the following checks:

- The top of the element is below the top of the viewport (zero or more).
- The bottom of the element is above the bottom of the viewport (less than `window.innerHeight`, which is the height of the viewport).

If both are true, then the element is fully visible.

# How to look under the hood

Other than by reading the code itself, you can enable three baked-in debugging options. To do this, you need to open the DevTools console, and switch to the extension context ("Egolatron" instead of "top" in the dropdown). Then, execute the following:

- For detailed logs: `_egolatron.setLog(true)`
- For detailed stats: `_egolatron.setStats(true)`
- For debug styles: `_egolatron.setDebug(true)`

To disable, pass `false` instead.

Enabling debug styles will also enable logs and stats, overriding their individual settings. The debug styles will show a blue border for tweets that are being analyzed, green for tweets confirmed to not be 'self-liked' and red for 'self-liked' tweets (this will replace the fancy styles with the animated medal). Oh, and purple means that the API request for that tweet returned an error.

Hope you enjoy it!

If you find funny self-liked tweets, [please send them my way](https://twitter.com/daniguardio_la) so we can share a laugh.

Also, I have some ideas for the future of this extension, like adding a stats UI or expanding to other platforms like Instagram or Facebook.
