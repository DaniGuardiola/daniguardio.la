I'm interested in design systems, so I am currently doing research on the topic starting with Design Tokens.

Here's a list of all the resources I've found along with some notes. I'll probably keep this list updated for some time.

Also, feel free to send more relevant resources my way: [hi@daniguardio.la](mailto:hi+designtokens@daniguardio.la)
