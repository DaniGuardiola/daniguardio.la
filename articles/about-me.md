My name is Dani and I'm a 21 years old engineer born in Spain with a focus on software and interface design. And dogs.

![Me](/me.jpg)

When I was a kid I always enjoyed building and creating stuff, so when I grew up it just made sense to make it a career. I moved to Madrid after I landed my first job as a programmer and I've worked with many different companies since.

Besides the software I develop for private companies, I've also worked on a bunch of personal projects that are mostly open source. I am in the process of writing [articles about some of the most interesting ones](/projects), check them out!

My main expertise is on Javascript and Node.js, with experience in both front and back-end for 6+ years. I have also worked with other languages and technologies such as php, python, bash, Bitcoin, AWS infrastructure, Linux... Sometimes I build side projects that involve cool stuff like a Gameboy emulator or an Arduino board.

Some tags with fun projects:

> Note: the tags don't work yet. I'm working on it, I just made this website yesterday! 

BTW! I made this website from scratch, [check the article I wrote about it](/project/daniguardiola-me) :)
