# My personal website (yes, the one you're currently looking at)

## Some history

I've had many websites since I was very young. I remember being a little kid, maybe 7 or 8, and playing around with Microsoft Frontpage (a WYSIWYG webpage editor) on my already-outdated Windows 98 machine.

More recently, when I turned 18 and I was already working on my first development job, I felt the need to have something professional and public, so I bought the `daniguardiola.me` domain, I copied a cool template and built a simple single-page portfolio on top of it. [Then I never ever updated it again other than to change my age.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171221154558/http://daniguardiola.me:80/)

At some point I decided that I needed a decent website so I started building one from scratch, using mainly vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS with a little bit of Polymer Material Design components here and there. [I almost finished it](https://web.archive.org/web/20180927120528/http://daniguardiola.me/daniguardiola-dotme/) and I liked it. It had some very nice parallax and the buttons had a cool ripple effect that colorfully expands to cover the whole container ([I made a gist explaining how it works](https://gist.github.com/DaniGuardiola/c4c623e58dee2a324900)). Please disregard the cringey SJW text- I was young I didn't know any better, ok? Also the dude in the picture is not me, it's a stock photo.
