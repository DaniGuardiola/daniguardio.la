A place for my music, projects and blog. Built with React, MDX and a lot of love.

## A little bit of history üìÖ

I've created many websites since I was very young. I remember being a little kid, maybe 7 or 8 years old, and messing around with Microsoft Frontpage (an extinct [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) webpage editor) in my already-outdated Windows 98 machine. Around that time, someone gifted me a book on HTML. I remember looking at the generated code trying to understand the tag soup.

Some years later I created a few different websites and blogs that I would abandon after a while. For example a spanish "comedy" blog that I updated with _high-profile_ contributions like... my cousin and some friends. We basically sh\*tposted before it was cool, at 12 years of age.

Fast forward a few years: I had just turned 18 and I already had my first development job, so I decided to build an online portfolio. I bought the `daniguardiola.me` domain and built a simple single-page portfolio based on a cool template I found... _Then I never ever updated it again other than to change my age._

After some time I decided (again) that I needed a decent and up-to-date website so I started building one from scratch, using mainly vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS with a few of the Polymer's Paper components (Material Design) here and there. I had a clear idea of what I wanted: some nice parallax and colorful menus.

I had a working demo in no time. However, I got really busy with my job and projects at the time and never finished it. I remember it was fun to build though.

And that was my last attempt at a personal website until now.

My personal webpage (this one) is now finished. It actually took me two different attempts... a year apart. But it's finally done!

## Motivation üéØ

I wanted a cool-ass website (but who doesn't?) for my random thoughts, projects, music, etc. Well-designed, fast and usable.

## Design üìê

The interface is as minimalistic as I could make it. It is cohesive, snappy and responsive.

It has a few subtle details like the title typewriter effect, the collapsable header (on scroll) and the section selection animation.

I wanted the aesthetics to be clean and a bit geeky, hence the monospace typography of the section links and article lists, and the typewriter effect.

For improved readability, the article font is a "slab" variant, and I've also fine-tuned other details like the font weight or the article width.

It also works for all screen sizes, every layout has been adapted for the best experience.

## Implementation üî®

The website has been implemented in React (with functional components and hooks) from scratch, with the help of `create-react-app` (boilerplate can be messy so thank you benevolent React Gods for this blessed tooling!).

The first version I made used plain JavaScript and custom implementations of routing and lazy loading. When I revisited the project again a year later, the first thing I did was replace the routing with [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) and the lazy loading stuff with [`React.lazy` and `Suspense`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html). I also converted the code to TypeScript and simplified (a lot!) the overall codebase.

There is no pagination in any article list because I don't think I'll ever really need that. The lists of projects and blog posts are included in the source itself and are part of the main bundle.

The articles are just markdown files. Originally they were requested in raw format, parsed and rendered directly on the browser using [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). After the rewrite I switched to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which pre-compiles the `.mdx` files into React code with code-splitting support. It also allows me to do fun things with the article content like custom rendering and what I call ["shortcodes"](/blog/markdown-shortcodes).

All of the content (blog posts, project articles, etc) lives in the `content/` directory. This allows me to update the website by just pushing changes to that directory. My CD/CI takes care of the rest.

## Related blog articles üìù

I wrote a few in-depth articles about my website. Check them out!

## To do ‚úîÔ∏è

There are still a few details that I need to take care of, including:

- Making #tags work.
- Adding some details to articles, like more shortcodes, anchor links and share buttons.
- Adding dates to the blog article list.
- Add an _archive_ section with a showcase of my old and obsolete projects.
- Come up with a nicer design for my [lab](https://lab.daniguardiola.me).
- Add a better default projects layout.
- Add a music section for my upcoming musical projects.
- Make some under-the-hood optimizations

And of course, the most important thing: **fill it up with content**.

That's all folks! Hope you enjoy your stay :)
