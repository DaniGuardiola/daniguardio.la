My name is Dani and I'm a 23 years old musician and software engineer from Spain.

![Me](/img/me.jpg)

I have a passion for music, interface design, engineering, free software (as in freedom) and more. I'm always looking forward to learn and experiment with new stuff (music genres, technologies, ideas...). That's why I try to do so many different and unrelated things. It's also _very fun_.
